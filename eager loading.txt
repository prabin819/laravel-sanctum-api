What is Eager Loading?
Eager loading in Laravel is a technique used to load related data for a model upfront, in a single query, to optimize performance and reduce the number of database queries.

By default, Laravel uses lazy loading, which means related data is fetched only when it is explicitly accessed. This can lead to the N+1 query problem, where multiple queries are executed unnecessarily. Eager loading solves this by retrieving all related data in advance.

Example of Eager Loading
Without Eager Loading (Lazy Loading):
php
Copy code
$offices = Office::all();

foreach ($offices as $office) {
    echo $office->country->name; // Triggers a query for each office
}
This results in N+1 queries:
1 query to fetch all offices.
1 query for each office to fetch its country.
For example:

sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM offices; -- Initial query to get offices
SELECT * FROM countries WHERE id = 1; -- Query for each country
SELECT * FROM countries WHERE id = 2; -- Query for each country
... (and so on for every office)
With Eager Loading:
php
Copy code
$offices = Office::with('country')->get();

foreach ($offices as $office) {
    echo $office->country->name; // No additional queries
}
This results in 2 queries:
1 query to fetch all offices.
1 query to fetch all related countries.
For example:

sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM offices; -- Fetch offices
SELECT * FROM countries WHERE id IN (1, 2, 3); -- Fetch related countries
How to Use Eager Loading
Basic Eager Loading: Use the with() method to specify the relationships you want to eager load.

php
Copy code
$offices = Office::with('country')->get();
Eager Loading Multiple Relationships: Pass an array to with() to load multiple relationships.

php
Copy code
$offices = Office::with(['country', 'employees'])->get();
Nested Eager Loading: You can load relationships of relationships.

php
Copy code
$offices = Office::with('country.city')->get();
When to Use Eager Loading
Avoiding the N+1 Query Problem: When you know you'll need related data for multiple records, eager loading is essential.
Optimizing Performance: Reduces the total number of database queries, making the application faster.
Improving Clarity: The code is cleaner and easier to maintain since all necessary data is fetched upfront.
Lazy vs. Eager Loading vs. Explicit Loading
Aspect	Lazy Loading	Eager Loading	Explicit Loading
When Data is Loaded	Data is loaded when accessed.	Data is loaded upfront.	Data is explicitly loaded later.
Number of Queries	Can result in multiple queries (N+1).	Reduces queries to a minimum.	Controlled by the developer.
Syntax	$office->country->name;	Office::with('country')->get();	$office->load('country');
Conclusion
Eager loading is a powerful tool to optimize database queries in Laravel. By fetching related data upfront, you can avoid unnecessary queries, improve application performance, and write cleaner, more maintainable code.
