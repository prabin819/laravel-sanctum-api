To handle cases where the requested Office record does not exist (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/office/13), you can use Laravel's built-in mechanisms for error handling. Here's how you can achieve this:

Enhanced Implementation
Update your show method to handle the case when the Office does not exist.

php
Copy code
/**
 * Display a specific office and its related country.
 *
 * @param int $id
 * @return \Illuminate\Http\JsonResponse
 */
public function show($id)
{
    // Attempt to find the office by its ID
    $office = Office::with('country')->find($id);

    // If the office is not found, return a 404 error response
    if (!$office) {
        return response()->json([
            'status' => 'error',
            'message' => 'Office not found',
        ], 404);
    }

    // If the office exists, return the office with its related country
    return response()->json([
        'status' => 'success',
        'data' => $office,
    ]);
}
Explanation
Using find Method:

$office = Office::with('country')->find($id) attempts to fetch the Office record with the given id.
If no record exists, find returns null.
Handling the null Case:

If $office is null, a 404 Not Found response is returned with a JSON error message.
Returning the Data If Found:

If the Office exists, the related Country is already eager loaded, and the data is returned in the response.
Alternative Approach: Exception Handling
You can rely on Laravel's built-in exception handling by using findOrFail:

php
Copy code
/**
 * Display a specific office and its related country.
 *
 * @param int $id
 * @return \Illuminate\Http\JsonResponse
 */
public function show($id)
{
    try {
        // Attempt to find the office by its ID or throw a ModelNotFoundException
        $office = Office::with('country')->findOrFail($id);

        // If found, return the office with its related country
        return response()->json([
            'status' => 'success',
            'data' => $office,
        ]);
    } catch (\Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\ModelNotFoundException $e) {
        // Handle the exception and return a 404 error response
        return response()->json([
            'status' => 'error',
            'message' => 'Office not found',
        ], 404);
    }
}
Advantages of findOrFail
Automatically throws an exception if the record doesn't exist.
Cleaner code as you don't need to manually check if the record is null.
Example Responses
1. When the Office Exists
Request: GET /api/office/1 Response:

json
Copy code
{
    "status": "success",
    "data": {
        "id": 1,
        "branch_name": "Main Office",
        "country_id": 1,
        "is_active": true,
        "created_at": "2025-01-10T10:00:00.000000Z",
        "updated_at": "2025-01-10T10:00:00.000000Z",
        "country": {
            "id": 1,
            "name": "USA",
            "created_at": "2025-01-09T10:00:00.000000Z",
            "updated_at": "2025-01-09T10:00:00.000000Z"
        }
    }
}
2. When the Office Does Not Exist
Request: GET /api/office/13 Response:

json
Copy code
{
    "status": "error",
    "message": "Office not found"
}
Best Practices
Global Exception Handling: Laravel automatically catches ModelNotFoundException and returns a 404 response. You can customize this behavior in the render method of the App\Exceptions\Handler class.

Route-Model Binding with findOrFail: You can still use route-model binding but ensure a custom error response is returned globally.

php
Copy code
public function show(Office $office)
{
    return response()->json([
        'status' => 'success',
        'data' => $office->load('country'),
    ]);
}
If the Office does not exist, Laravel will automatically handle it with a 404.
