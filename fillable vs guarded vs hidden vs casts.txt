Based on the user migration you provided, here's the fillable array for the User model. This array defines which fields can be mass-assigned when creating or updating a user.

User.php (Model)
php
Copy code
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;
use Illuminate\Notifications\Notifiable;
use Laravel\Sanctum\HasApiTokens;

class User extends Authenticatable
{
    use HasApiTokens, Notifiable;

    /**
     * The attributes that are mass assignable.
     *
     * @var array
     */
    protected $fillable = [
        'user_group_id',
        'kitchen_id',
        'customer_id',
        'delivery_person_id',
        'office_id',
        'name',
        'phone_no',
        'email',
        'password',
        'status',
        'otp',
        'otp_expiry_time',
    ];

    /**
     * The attributes that should be hidden for arrays.
     *
     * @var array
     */
    protected $hidden = [
        'password',
        'remember_token',
        'otp',
    ];

    /**
     * The attributes that should be cast to native types.
     *
     * @var array
     */
    protected $casts = [
        'email_verified_at' => 'datetime',
        'otp_expiry_time' => 'datetime',
        'status' => 'boolean',
    ];
}
Explanation
fillable:

The fillable array includes all the columns from your migration that can be mass-assigned. These are typically fields you expect to populate in bulk, such as during user registration or updates.
hidden:

The hidden array specifies attributes that should not be included when the model is converted to an array or JSON. For security, sensitive fields like password and otp are hidden.
casts:

The casts array ensures that certain attributes are automatically cast to native types when you retrieve them from the database. For example:
otp_expiry_time is cast to a datetime object.
status is cast to a boolean.
This fillable array and other configurations ensure your User model is secure and behaves predictably when handling user data. Let me know if there’s anything else you'd like to add or modify!

differentiate between hidden and guarded

In Laravel, hidden and guarded serve different purposes in a model:

1. hidden
Purpose: Specifies which attributes should not be visible when the model is converted to an array or JSON.
Use Case: Protect sensitive fields (e.g., passwords, tokens, OTPs) from being exposed in API responses or frontend views.
Example:
php
Copy code
protected $hidden = ['password', 'remember_token', 'otp'];
When you return a user instance as a JSON response:
php
Copy code
return User::find(1);
The response will exclude the password, remember_token, and otp fields.
Output:
json
Copy code
{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com"
}
2. guarded
Purpose: Specifies which attributes cannot be mass-assigned. It works as the opposite of fillable.
Use Case: Prevent accidental mass-assignment of specific fields (e.g., id, admin, role) for security reasons.
Example:
php
Copy code
protected $guarded = ['id', 'admin'];
If you attempt to create or update a user with guarded attributes:
php
Copy code
User::create([
    'id' => 999,
    'name' => 'John Doe',
    'email' => 'john@example.com',
    'admin' => true,
]);
Laravel will ignore the id and admin attributes because they are guarded.
Key Differences
Feature	Hidden	Guarded
Purpose	Excludes attributes from model output.	Prevents attributes from mass-assignment.
Scope	Affects output when the model is converted to an array or JSON.	Affects model creation or updates using mass-assignment methods (create, update, etc.).
Default	Sensitive fields like password or remember_token.	Fields that are not safe for bulk assignment (e.g., id, admin, role).
Example	protected $hidden = ['password'];	protected $guarded = ['id'];
When to Use Each?
Use hidden to prevent certain fields from being exposed in API responses or frontend data.
Use guarded to protect sensitive fields from being unintentionally overwritten or assigned during mass assignment.
Pro Tip:
If you're using both, they work independently. For example:
php
Copy code
protected $hidden = ['password'];
protected $guarded = ['id'];
password won’t appear in the API response (due to hidden).
id cannot be mass-assigned (due to guarded).

are fields automatically guarded if not specified in fillable?
ChatGPT said:

Yes, in Laravel, fields are automatically guarded if they are not specified in the fillable array. By default, Laravel protects all attributes from mass assignment unless they are explicitly listed in the fillable array.

How It Works:
fillable:

Defines which attributes are allowed for mass assignment.
If an attribute is not in the fillable array, Laravel will reject attempts to assign it using mass-assignment methods like create or update.
Example:
php
Copy code
protected $fillable = ['name', 'email', 'phone_no'];
If you attempt to create a user with extra attributes:

php
Copy code
User::create([
    'name' => 'John Doe',
    'email' => 'john@example.com',
    'phone_no' => '1234567890',
    'admin' => true, // Not in fillable
]);
Laravel will ignore the admin field and throw a MassAssignmentException if strict mode is enabled.

guarded:

Works as the opposite of fillable. It defines attributes that are not allowed for mass assignment.
If you don’t want to explicitly specify fillable, you can use guarded to protect specific fields while allowing all others to be mass-assigned.
Example:
php
Copy code
protected $guarded = ['id', 'admin'];
This means:

Only the id and admin fields are protected.
Any other fields in your migration can be mass-assigned.
What Happens If Neither is Defined?
If both fillable and guarded are empty, Laravel assumes that all fields are guarded by default, preventing mass assignment.
To allow all fields for mass assignment, you can set guarded to an empty array:
php
Copy code
protected $guarded = [];
Summary of Behavior
Scenario	Effect
fillable is defined	Only the attributes in the fillable array can be mass-assigned.
guarded is defined	All attributes are mass-assignable except those listed in the guarded array.
Neither fillable nor guarded is set	All attributes are protected from mass assignment by default.
guarded is set to an empty array ([])	All attributes are mass-assignable (not recommended unless you fully trust the input data source).
Best Practice:
Use fillable: Explicitly list the fields you want to allow for mass assignment. This approach is safer and avoids accidental overwrites of sensitive fields.
Avoid setting guarded = [] unless you have a strong reason and full control over the data being assigned.
