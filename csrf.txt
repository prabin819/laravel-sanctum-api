Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a type of attack where a malicious actor tricks the user into performing actions they did not intend to, on a site where they are authenticated. To prevent such attacks, CSRF tokens are used. Here’s how they work in detail:

1. The CSRF Attack
In a CSRF attack, an attacker uses the trust that a website has for the user's browser. For example:

A user logs into their online bank account.
The session is stored in the user's browser (usually via cookies).
The attacker sends a malicious request (e.g., a transfer of money) from a different site, knowing the user is logged in.
The browser automatically includes the valid session cookie with the request, making it seem like the user initiated the request.
2. What is a CSRF Token?
A CSRF token is a unique, unpredictable value that is generated by the server and tied to a user's session. This token is included in the form or request headers sent to the server. When the request is submitted back to the server, it includes the token.

3. How Does a CSRF Token Work?
The CSRF token works as a secret key that is known only to the server and the authenticated user. Here's the step-by-step process:

Step 1: Server Generates CSRF Token
When a user first accesses a website and logs in, the server generates a CSRF token. This token is:

Randomly generated.
Unique to the user's session.
Stored on the server (often in the session or a database).
Sent to the client (browser) and usually embedded in the HTML of the page within a hidden form field or as part of HTTP headers.
Step 2: Token Embedded in Forms
When the user visits a page that requires making a state-changing request (e.g., submitting a form), the server embeds the CSRF token in the form. This ensures that the token is sent back to the server when the form is submitted.

Example (form with CSRF token):

html
Copy code
<form method="POST" action="/change-password">
  <input type="hidden" name="csrf_token" value="randomly_generated_token_value">
  <!-- Other form fields -->
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
Step 3: User Submits the Form
When the user submits the form, the CSRF token is included in the form data, and the browser sends it along with the other form data (e.g., name, password).

Step 4: Server Verifies the Token
When the server receives the request, it verifies that the CSRF token sent by the user matches the one stored on the server for the user's session. If the token is missing or doesn't match, the server rejects the request as potentially malicious.

Step 5: Action is Performed
If the token is valid and the request is legitimate, the server processes the action (e.g., updating a user's profile, making a purchase, etc.).

4. Why CSRF Tokens Prevent Attacks
Unique per session: The CSRF token is tied to the session, meaning an attacker cannot predict or reuse it.
Not accessible to attackers: Since the CSRF token is stored in a form or HTTP header, and not in a URL or cookie, an attacker cannot easily steal it from the user’s browser unless they have access to the session.
Verifiable: The token is verified on every request. If an attacker tries to forge a request (e.g., by sending a link to the user with a malicious action), they would not be able to supply a valid CSRF token, and the request will be rejected.
5. Implementation Tips
Use HTTP Headers: CSRF tokens can also be passed via HTTP headers for AJAX requests. This is a common pattern in modern web applications.
Same-origin policy: CSRF tokens leverage the same-origin policy where the browser will only send cookies to the same domain. This ensures that the attacker cannot forge the request with valid session cookies from another domain.
Token Lifetime: Tokens should have a limited lifespan to reduce the window of opportunity for an attacker.
Use Secure Connections (HTTPS): Ensure that the CSRF token is transmitted over HTTPS to prevent it from being intercepted.
6. Common Issues and Considerations
Caching: Be cautious with caching mechanisms, as caching pages that include a CSRF token could expose users to risks.
Token Storage: Storing the CSRF token securely on the server is crucial to prevent it from being tampered with or stolen.
Double-Submit Cookies: An alternative method to CSRF tokens is to use cookies. The CSRF token can be stored in a cookie that is automatically sent with the request, but this requires additional validation to ensure it matches the token sent in the request body.
Conclusion
CSRF tokens are essential in preventing unauthorized actions on a site, ensuring that every state-changing request (like form submissions) comes from a legitimate source. They work by verifying that the request originates from the same session and not from a malicious third-party website.
