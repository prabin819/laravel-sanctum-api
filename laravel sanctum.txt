How Laravel Sanctum Works
Laravel Sanctum is a lightweight authentication system for Single Page Applications (SPAs), mobile applications, and simple token-based APIs. It provides a simple way to authenticate users via API tokens or session-based authentication.

Key Features of Sanctum
API Token Authentication:

Allows users to generate personal access tokens.
Tokens are stored in the database and can have specific abilities (permissions).
Session-Based Authentication:

For SPAs, Sanctum uses Laravel's built-in session cookies for authentication.
Token Abilities:

Tokens can have "abilities" to restrict their usage for specific actions.
Revoking Tokens:

Tokens can be revoked or deleted easily by managing database records.
How It Works
1. Setting Up Sanctum
Install Sanctum:

bash
Copy code
composer require laravel/sanctum
Publish Sanctum configuration:

bash
Copy code
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Laravel\Sanctum\SanctumServiceProvider"
Run migrations to create the personal_access_tokens table:

bash
Copy code
php artisan migrate
Add Sanctum's middleware to the api guard in config/auth.php:

php
Copy code
'guards' => [
    'api' => [
        'driver' => 'sanctum',
        'provider' => 'users',
    ],
],
Add Sanctum's middleware in app/Http/Kernel.php:

php
Copy code
'api' => [
    \Laravel\Sanctum\Http\Middleware\EnsureFrontendRequestsAreStateful::class,
    'throttle:api',
    \Illuminate\Routing\Middleware\SubstituteBindings::class,
],
2. API Token Authentication
Sanctum provides a way for users to create tokens for API access. Each token is tied to a specific user and can have abilities (permissions).

Example: Generating a Token
php
Copy code
use App\Models\User;

$user = User::find(1); // Find the user
$token = $user->createToken('myapptoken', ['read', 'write'])->plainTextToken;

// Return the token to the client
return response()->json(['token' => $token]);
What Happens?

A new record is created in the personal_access_tokens table.
The token is returned as a plain text string (plainTextToken), which the client stores for future API requests.
3. Using Tokens for API Requests
Clients use the generated token to authenticate API requests by including it in the Authorization header:

http
Copy code
Authorization: Bearer {token}
Example: Protecting Routes
Add the auth:sanctum middleware to routes that require authentication:

php
Copy code
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

Route::middleware('auth:sanctum')->get('/user', function (Request $request) {
    return $request->user();
});
Sanctum validates the token by:

Extracting the token ID from the token string.
Looking up the token in the personal_access_tokens table.
Verifying the hashed token and checking its abilities.
4. Token Abilities
Abilities restrict what actions a token can perform.

Example: Assigning Abilities
php
Copy code
$token = $user->createToken('myapptoken', ['read', 'write'])->plainTextToken;
Example: Checking Abilities in Routes
php
Copy code
Route::middleware(['auth:sanctum'])->get('/resource', function (Request $request) {
    if ($request->user()->tokenCan('read')) {
        return 'You can access this resource.';
    }
    return response('Forbidden', 403);
});
5. Revoking Tokens
Tokens can be revoked by deleting them from the database.

Example: Revoke a Single Token
php
Copy code
$tokenId = 1; // ID of the token to revoke
$user->tokens()->where('id', $tokenId)->delete();
Example: Revoke All Tokens
php
Copy code
$user->tokens()->delete();
6. SPA Authentication
For SPAs, Sanctum uses session-based authentication.

Steps:
Ensure the SPA sends cookies with cross-origin requests.
Add Sanctum’s EnsureFrontendRequestsAreStateful middleware to your api middleware group.
Authenticate users via Laravel’s built-in login routes:
php
Copy code
Route::post('/login', [AuthenticatedSessionController::class, 'store']);
Route::post('/logout', [AuthenticatedSessionController::class, 'destroy']);
Example Workflow
1. User Login and Token Generation
php
Copy code
use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use App\Models\User;

Route::post('/login', function (Request $request) {
    $credentials = $request->only('email', 'password');

    if (!auth()->attempt($credentials)) {
        return response()->json(['message' => 'Invalid login'], 401);
    }

    $user = auth()->user();
    $token = $user->createToken('myapptoken', ['read', 'write'])->plainTextToken;

    return response()->json(['token' => $token]);
});
2. Accessing Protected Routes
php
Copy code
Route::middleware('auth:sanctum')->get('/profile', function (Request $request) {
    return $request->user();
});
3. Revoking Tokens
php
Copy code
Route::post('/logout', function (Request $request) {
    $request->user()->tokens()->delete();

    return response()->json(['message' => 'Logged out']);
});
Summary
Laravel Sanctum is a simple way to authenticate users for APIs, SPAs, and mobile apps.
It uses simple tokens (not JWT) stored in the database.
Tokens can have specific abilities and are easy to revoke.
Sanctum supports session-based authentication for SPAs and token-based authentication for APIs.
This flexibility makes Sanctum a great choice for applications that need secure, lightweight, and easy-to-manage authentication.

Session-Based Authentication in Sanctum (for SPAs)
Sanctum provides a simple and secure way to authenticate Single Page Applications (SPAs) using session-based authentication. This method leverages Laravel's built-in session management, which uses cookies to manage user sessions.

Here’s how session-based authentication works in Sanctum for SPAs:

Key Concepts
Session-Based Authentication:

In traditional web applications, session-based authentication is often used where the server stores session data in a session store (like a file or a database), and a session cookie is sent to the browser. This cookie is automatically included in requests to authenticate the user.
In SPAs, the front-end (JavaScript) makes requests to the backend (API), and the session is managed via cookies, similar to how cookies are used in traditional server-rendered applications.
Sanctum and SPAs:

Sanctum allows you to use session-based authentication for SPAs by leveraging Laravel's session cookies. This means that Sanctum doesn't require you to manually send tokens in API requests like you would with token-based authentication systems.
Instead, Laravel handles the session management for you, and the browser automatically includes the session cookie with each request to authenticate the user.
How Session-Based Authentication Works with Sanctum:
Login Process:

When a user logs in (via the /login route or some other mechanism), Laravel creates a session for the user and stores it in the session store (e.g., in the database or file system).
The session ID is then sent back to the client in a cookie (usually named laravel_session), which is stored in the browser’s cookie store.
Cookie-Based Authentication:

After the login, every subsequent request made by the SPA (via JavaScript or AJAX) will automatically include the session cookie (using the laravel_session cookie).
Laravel uses this cookie to identify the session, so the user doesn't need to manually include a token with each API request. The cookie automatically associates the request with the authenticated user.
CSRF Protection:

Laravel also uses Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection in conjunction with session-based authentication.
When making requests from the front end to the backend, the SPA must include a CSRF token in the header (usually included as X-XSRF-TOKEN).
This CSRF token is sent as a cookie (with the name XSRF-TOKEN), and Laravel validates it to ensure that the request is coming from the same origin and not from a third-party malicious site.
Session Expiry:

The session is typically tied to a cookie with an expiry time, which means that the user will remain authenticated until the session expires or is manually logged out.
If the session expires, the user will have to log in again to create a new session and obtain a new session cookie.
Steps Involved in Session-Based Authentication with Sanctum in an SPA:
User Login:

The user enters credentials (e.g., username and password) and submits them to the backend.
The backend authenticates the user and generates a session. The session ID is saved in a session cookie.
Requesting Resources:

The SPA (front-end application) sends an API request to the backend.
The browser automatically includes the session cookie (e.g., laravel_session) with the request.
Session Validation:

The backend verifies the session by checking the session cookie against the session store (database or file).
If the session is valid, the user is authenticated, and the backend responds to the request (e.g., sending data or performing an action).
CSRF Token:

Along with the session cookie, the SPA includes the CSRF token (X-XSRF-TOKEN) in the request headers.
The backend validates the CSRF token to ensure that the request is legitimate.
Logout:

When the user logs out, the backend invalidates the session and deletes the session cookie.
The user is no longer authenticated until they log in again and receive a new session.
Advantages of Session-Based Authentication for SPAs:
Simplicity:
No need to manually handle authentication tokens in every request. The session cookie is automatically included by the browser.
Automatic Handling of Sessions:
Laravel automatically handles session expiration, renewal, and management for you, making it easier to maintain user sessions over time.
Security:
The session cookie is sent over secure connections (HTTPS), and Laravel also provides built-in CSRF protection to guard against cross-site request forgery attacks.
Seamless User Experience:
Users don’t need to manually manage tokens or deal with token expiration. The session cookie automatically handles the authentication process as long as the session is active.
Setup Example in Laravel for SPAs Using Session-Based Authentication
To enable session-based authentication with Sanctum for SPAs, follow these steps:

Sanctum Configuration:

In config/sanctum.php, ensure the stateful domain is configured correctly (the domain where your SPA is served from).
Example:
php
Copy code
'stateful' => [
    'your-frontend-domain.com',
],
CORS Configuration:

Ensure that your CORS settings allow requests from your SPA domain. Update config/cors.php:
php
Copy code
'allowed_origins' => ['https://your-frontend-domain.com'],
CSRF Middleware:

Include the necessary CSRF middleware in your api.php routes:
php
Copy code
Route::middleware('auth:sanctum')->get('/user', function (Request $request) {
    return $request->user();
});
Login Endpoint:

Create a login endpoint where users can authenticate, which will automatically handle the session management.
php
Copy code
Route::post('/login', function (Request $request) {
    $credentials = $request->validate([
        'email' => 'required|email',
        'password' => 'required',
    ]);
    
    if (Auth::attempt($credentials)) {
        return response()->json(['message' => 'Successfully logged in']);
    }
    
    return response()->json(['message' => 'Invalid credentials'], 401);
});
Making Requests from SPA:

In your frontend (JavaScript), you can now make API requests to the backend, and the session cookie will automatically handle the authentication:
javascript
Copy code
axios.get('https://your-backend-domain.com/api/user', {
    withCredentials: true, // Important to include the session cookie
}).then(response => {
    console.log(response.data);
});
Conclusion:
Session-based authentication for SPAs using Sanctum is a simple and secure way to authenticate users. It leverages Laravel's session management system and automatically handles session cookies and CSRF protection, providing a seamless authentication experience for users. This method is ideal for SPAs that need to authenticate users without manually managing API tokens.
