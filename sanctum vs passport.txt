Laravel Passport vs Laravel Sanctum
Both Laravel Passport and Sanctum are tools for implementing authentication in Laravel, but they differ significantly in their use cases, underlying mechanisms, and features. Here's a detailed explanation of how Passport works and how it compares to Sanctum.

1. Laravel Passport
Overview
Laravel Passport is an OAuth 2.0 server implementation for Laravel.
It is suited for applications that need to support OAuth 2.0 authorization flows, typically for third-party integrations or public APIs.
How Passport Works
Passport provides tools for implementing OAuth 2.0, which includes several grant types for different authentication scenarios. Here's how it works:

Installation:

Install Passport and run the migrations to create the necessary tables.
The primary tables include:
oauth_clients: Stores client apps that can request tokens.
oauth_access_tokens: Stores issued access tokens.
oauth_refresh_tokens: Stores refresh tokens for renewing access tokens.
oauth_auth_codes: Stores temporary auth codes used in authorization code grants.
Client Registration:

Applications (clients) that want to interact with your API must register and receive a client_id and client_secret.
Token Issuance:

Passport generates access tokens for authenticated users or clients.
OAuth 2.0 flows determine how tokens are issued (e.g., Password Grant, Client Credentials, or Authorization Code Grant).
Token Usage:

Clients include the access token in the Authorization header of API requests: Authorization: Bearer <token>.
Token Validation:

Passport validates the token's authenticity and checks its expiration, scope, and associated user.
Grant Types Supported by Passport
Password Grant:

Allows users to log in using their email and password to get an access token.
Example use case: Mobile apps or custom SPAs.
Authorization Code Grant:

Used for third-party applications (e.g., "Login with Google/Facebook").
Client Credentials Grant:

Used for machine-to-machine authentication (e.g., microservices).
Implicit Grant:

Deprecated but used for browser-based apps with limited backend support.
Refresh Tokens:

Allows renewal of expired tokens without requiring the user to log in again.
When to Use Passport
You need to build a first-party or third-party API that follows the OAuth 2.0 protocol.
Your application needs token-based authentication with scopes to define permissions.
You want to provide third-party access to your API (e.g., allowing external apps to authenticate users via your app).
2. Laravel Sanctum
Overview
Laravel Sanctum is a lightweight authentication package for SPAs, mobile apps, and simple token-based APIs.
It is more straightforward than Passport and does not implement the OAuth 2.0 protocol.
How Sanctum Works
Sanctum provides two main authentication methods:

Session-Based Authentication:

For SPAs that share the same domain as the backend, Sanctum uses Laravel's session cookies for authentication.
Example: A React or Vue frontend served from the same domain as the Laravel backend.
Token-Based Authentication:

For APIs or mobile applications, Sanctum uses personal access tokens.
Tokens are created using createToken() and stored in the personal_access_tokens table.
API clients send these tokens in the Authorization header: Authorization: Bearer <token>.
When to Use Sanctum
You need to authenticate first-party SPAs or mobile apps.
You don’t need the full OAuth 2.0 implementation.
You want simple, developer-friendly token-based authentication.
Key Differences Between Passport and Sanctum
Feature	Laravel Passport	Laravel Sanctum
Purpose	Full OAuth 2.0 implementation	Lightweight API authentication
Protocol	OAuth 2.0	Custom, simpler implementation
Token Management	Tokens stored in oauth_access_tokens table	Tokens stored in personal_access_tokens table
Third-Party Access	Supports third-party applications	Not designed for third-party apps
Grant Types	Supports multiple grant types (e.g., Password, Client Credentials, Authorization Code)	Only supports personal access tokens
Ease of Use	More complex (OAuth 2.0 setup)	Simpler and easier to set up
Session-Based Authentication	No	Yes (for SPAs sharing the same domain)
Use Case	Public APIs, third-party integrations	First-party SPAs, mobile apps, simple APIs
Scalability	Better for large-scale systems	Suitable for simpler systems
Token Expiry & Refresh	Supports refresh tokens	Does not support refresh tokens (recreate token instead)
When to Use Passport vs Sanctum
Use Passport When:
You need a full OAuth 2.0 implementation.
Your API will be accessed by third-party applications.
You require multiple grant types (e.g., Authorization Code, Client Credentials).
You need strict scope-based permission management.
Use Sanctum When:
You are building a first-party SPA or mobile app.
You need simple token-based authentication without OAuth 2.0 complexity.
Your frontend and backend share the same domain (use session-based auth).
You are building a small-scale API without third-party integrations.
Conclusion
Passport is a heavyweight solution that implements OAuth 2.0 for large-scale applications requiring third-party access and strict security.
Sanctum is a simpler, more flexible solution for first-party applications, SPAs, and basic APIs that don’t require OAuth 2.0.
Choose based on the complexity, scale, and requirements of your application!
