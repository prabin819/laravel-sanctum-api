Understanding Session-Based Authentication in Laravel Sanctum
Session-based authentication is used when you are building Single Page Applications (SPAs) that communicate with your Laravel backend. It relies on cookies and sessions, rather than manually passing tokens in headers like in traditional API token-based authentication.

1. How Session-Based Authentication Works
With Sanctum, Laravel uses session cookies to authenticate users in SPAs. Here's how the process works step by step:

Step 1: User Logs In
The SPA sends a login request to your Laravel backend (e.g., via /login).
Laravel validates the user's credentials using the Auth system (e.g., Auth::attempt()).
If the credentials are valid:
Laravel creates a session for the authenticated user.
A session cookie is issued to the SPA's browser.
Step 2: Browser Stores the Cookie
The browser automatically stores the session cookie.
This cookie is attached to subsequent requests to the Laravel backend automatically by the browser.
Step 3: Authentication via the Cookie
When the SPA makes an API request (e.g., /user), the session cookie is included with the request.
Laravel identifies the user based on the session tied to the cookie and authenticates the request.
Step 4: Protecting Routes
The middleware auth:sanctum is used to protect routes.
It ensures the request has a valid session cookie and that the user is authenticated.
2. Why Use Session-Based Authentication for SPAs?
SPAs often run in the same domain as the Laravel backend or use subdomains. Session-based authentication is preferred because:

Security: Cookies are automatically sent with requests, and Laravel protects against CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) attacks using CSRF tokens.
Ease of Use: You don’t need to manually manage tokens in the frontend.
Compatibility: Since cookies are a native browser feature, it works seamlessly with most frontend frameworks.
3. Key Features of Sanctum for Session-Based Authentication
a. CSRF Protection
Laravel automatically adds CSRF protection to forms and AJAX requests.
The SPA must include the CSRF token in its requests (usually handled by frontend frameworks).
b. Stateful Domains
Sanctum uses the stateful configuration in config/sanctum.php to define the domains that should use session-based authentication.
Example:
php
Copy code
'stateful' => [
    'localhost',
    'my-spa.example.com',
],
Only requests from these domains will use session-based authentication.
4. Example Workflow
Here’s an example of how a session-based SPA authentication flow works:

Backend Setup
Enable Sanctum Middleware: Sanctum provides middleware to handle session-based authentication for SPAs:

php
Copy code
'middleware' => [
    'verify_csrf_token' => \App\Http\Middleware\VerifyCsrfToken::class,
    'encrypt_cookies' => \App\Http\Middleware\EncryptCookies::class,
],
Protect API Routes: Use the auth:sanctum middleware to protect routes that require authentication:

php
Copy code
Route::middleware('auth:sanctum')->get('/user', function (Request $request) {
    return $request->user();
});
Login Route: Handle login using Laravel's Auth system:

php
Copy code
Route::post('/login', function (Request $request) {
    $credentials = $request->only('email', 'password');
    if (Auth::attempt($credentials)) {
        $request->session()->regenerate(); // Prevent session fixation
        return response()->json(['message' => 'Logged in successfully.']);
    }
    return response()->json(['message' => 'Invalid credentials.'], 401);
});
Logout Route: Handle logout by invalidating the user's session:

php
Copy code
Route::post('/logout', function (Request $request) {
    Auth::logout();
    $request->session()->invalidate();
    $request->session()->regenerateToken();
    return response()->json(['message' => 'Logged out successfully.']);
});
Frontend Setup
Login:

Send a POST request to /login with the user's credentials.
Example (using Axios):
javascript
Copy code
axios.post('/login', { email, password })
    .then(response => console.log('Logged in:', response))
    .catch(error => console.error('Login failed:', error));
Authenticated API Requests:

After login, the browser automatically sends the session cookie with each subsequent request.
Example:
javascript
Copy code
axios.get('/user')
    .then(response => console.log('User data:', response.data))
    .catch(error => console.error('Not authenticated:', error));
Logout:

Send a POST request to /logout to invalidate the session.
Example:
javascript
Copy code
axios.post('/logout')
    .then(response => console.log('Logged out:', response))
    .catch(error => console.error('Logout failed:', error));
5. Comparing Session-Based vs Token-Based Authentication
Feature	Session-Based Authentication	Token-Based Authentication
Authentication Mechanism	Session cookies tied to server sessions	Tokens sent in headers
Frontend Management	No need to manage tokens; cookies are automatic	Tokens must be stored (e.g., local storage or cookies)
Security	Protected by CSRF tokens and same-site cookies	Depends on secure storage and token expiration
Use Case	SPAs on the same domain or subdomain	Mobile apps, third-party clients, or external APIs
6. Summary
Session-based authentication in Laravel Sanctum is ideal for SPAs because:

It simplifies authentication by using session cookies.
It leverages Laravel's built-in CSRF protection for security.
It is more user-friendly for SPAs running on the same domain as the backend.
If your SPA and backend are hosted together, session-based authentication with Sanctum is a secure and efficient choice.

first explain what is session
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
What is a Session?
A session is a way to store data for individual users across multiple requests to a web application. It allows the server to remember information (state) about a user during their visit (or session) to the website or application. Sessions are essential for maintaining user-specific data in a stateless protocol like HTTP, which does not inherently remember users between requests.

Key Characteristics of a Session
User-Specific:

Each session is unique to a user and identified by a session ID.
The session ID is stored on the client (typically in a cookie) and sent with each request so the server can identify the user.
Temporary:

A session lasts as long as the user is active or until they log out or the session times out.
Server-Side Storage:

Session data is stored on the server, often in memory, files, or a database.
The client only sends the session ID, not the actual session data.
Secure:

The session ID is sensitive and must be protected to prevent hijacking or impersonation.
How Sessions Work
Here’s a step-by-step explanation of how sessions work:

1. User Makes a Request
A user sends a request to the server (e.g., logging in to an application).
2. Server Creates a Session
After validating the user’s credentials, the server creates a session and assigns it a unique session ID.
The session ID is stored on the server (with associated data) and sent back to the client in the form of a cookie.
3. Client Stores the Session ID
The client (browser) stores the session ID cookie.
For example:
css
Copy code
Set-Cookie: session_id=abc123; HttpOnly; Secure
4. Client Sends the Session ID
With every subsequent request, the browser automatically sends the session ID cookie to the server.
Example:
makefile
Copy code
Cookie: session_id=abc123
5. Server Identifies the Session
The server uses the session ID to look up the corresponding session data.
If the session is valid, the server retrieves the stored data and processes the request.
6. Session Expires
If the session times out or the user logs out, the session is destroyed, and the server will no longer recognize the session ID.
Use Case of Sessions
Sessions are commonly used for:

Authentication:

Storing whether a user is logged in.
Associating the session with the authenticated user's ID.
Cart Management:

Storing shopping cart data for e-commerce websites.
Preferences:

Saving user preferences, such as language or theme settings.
Sessions in Laravel
In Laravel, session management is built-in and highly customizable. Laravel uses the Session service to handle session data.

Default Behavior
By default, Laravel stores session data in files, but it can also use databases, Redis, or other storage mechanisms.
Session configuration is managed in the config/session.php file.
Session Example in Laravel
php
Copy code
// Storing data in the session
session(['key' => 'value']);

// Retrieving data from the session
$value = session('key');

// Forgetting a session key
session()->forget('key');

// Destroying a session
session()->invalidate();
Summary
A session is a mechanism to store user-specific data across multiple requests in a web application. It allows the server to remember who the user is and maintain state (e.g., logged-in status). In Laravel, sessions are easy to work with and provide powerful tools for managing user data securely and efficiently.

give me an example of session data created at the backend during login for authenticating a user
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Here’s an example of how session data is created at the backend during login for authenticating a user:

Step-by-Step Workflow
1. User Submits Login Request
The user sends a POST request to the /login endpoint with their credentials (email and password).
2. Backend Validates Credentials
The server checks the credentials using Laravel’s Auth::attempt() method.
If the credentials are valid, Laravel authenticates the user and creates a session.
Example Code: Login Endpoint
php
Copy code
use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;

Route::post('/login', function (Request $request) {
    // Validate the request data
    $credentials = $request->validate([
        'email' => 'required|email',
        'password' => 'required',
    ]);

    // Attempt to log in the user
    if (Auth::attempt($credentials)) {
        // Regenerate session to prevent session fixation attacks
        $request->session()->regenerate();

        // Return success response
        return response()->json(['message' => 'Login successful.']);
    }

    // If authentication fails, return error response
    return response()->json(['message' => 'Invalid credentials.'], 401);
});
3. Laravel Creates Session Data
When Auth::attempt() successfully authenticates the user, Laravel creates a session and stores the following user-specific data on the server in the session store (e.g., file, database, Redis):

Example Session Data
Here’s what a typical session might look like on the server:

json
Copy code
{
    "id": "abc123xyz",                // Unique session ID
    "user_id": 1,                     // Authenticated user's ID
    "user_email": "user@example.com", // Optional user data (not always stored)
    "is_authenticated": true,         // Indicates the user is logged in
    "created_at": "2025-01-12T12:34:56Z", // Session creation timestamp
    "csrf_token": "token_generated_for_csrf_protection"
}
This data is stored in the session store (e.g., in a file, database, or memory) and tied to the unique session ID.

4. Session ID Sent to the Client
Laravel sends the session ID back to the client as a cookie. For example:
http
Copy code
Set-Cookie: laravel_session=abc123xyz; Path=/; HttpOnly; Secure
The laravel_session cookie contains the session ID, and the browser stores it.
5. Subsequent Requests
When the user makes another request (e.g., to a protected route), the browser automatically includes the session ID cookie:
http
Copy code
Cookie: laravel_session=abc123xyz
Laravel uses the session ID to find the corresponding session data in the store and determines the authenticated user.
Example of Accessing Session Data in Laravel
You can access the authenticated user and session data easily:

Access Authenticated User
php
Copy code
Route::get('/user', function (Request $request) {
    $user = $request->user(); // Gets the currently authenticated user
    return response()->json($user);
});
Access Raw Session Data
php
Copy code
Route::get('/session-data', function (Request $request) {
    // Get session data for the current user
    return response()->json($request->session()->all());
});
Summary of the Process
User submits login credentials to the backend.
Laravel authenticates the user using Auth::attempt().
A session is created and user-specific data (e.g., user_id) is stored in the session store.
The session ID is sent back to the client as a cookie.
For subsequent requests, the client sends the session ID cookie, and Laravel retrieves the corresponding session data to authenticate the user.
This process ensures secure and seamless user authentication using sessions.






You said:
i dont see any sessionid being sent to the user/frontend:/ /Return success response
        return response()->json(['message' => 'Login successful.']);
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
You are absolutely correct that the example code does not explicitly send the session ID to the frontend in the response. Let me clarify how the session ID is transmitted and used in session-based authentication.

How the Session ID Is Sent
In Laravel, the session ID is not manually sent in the JSON response. Instead, it is handled automatically by the browser and Laravel's session management system. Here's how it works:

Session ID Stored in a Cookie:

After the user is authenticated (Auth::attempt()), Laravel generates a session and assigns it a unique session ID.
This session ID is sent back to the client as a cookie in the HTTP response headers.
The browser automatically stores this cookie.
No Manual Session ID Handling:

The developer does not need to explicitly include the session ID in the JSON response because the browser will manage the cookie for subsequent requests.
Example of HTTP Response with the Session ID
After a successful login, the server sends an HTTP response that includes the session cookie. For instance:

http
Copy code
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Set-Cookie: laravel_session=abc123xyz; Path=/; HttpOnly; Secure
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "message": "Login successful."
}
Here:

Set-Cookie Header: Contains the session ID (laravel_session=abc123xyz).
HttpOnly: Prevents JavaScript from accessing the cookie, enhancing security.
Secure: Ensures the cookie is sent only over HTTPS.
Subsequent Requests
Once the session cookie is stored in the browser, it will automatically be included in all subsequent requests to the same domain. For example:

Request from Frontend
http
Copy code
GET /user
Cookie: laravel_session=abc123xyz
Server Processing
Laravel retrieves the session ID from the Cookie header and loads the corresponding session data from the session store.
If the session is valid, the user is considered authenticated.
Why Not Include Session ID in JSON Response?
Laravel's session-based authentication is designed to rely on cookies for simplicity and security:

Automatic Handling:
The browser automatically stores and sends cookies without manual intervention.
Security:
Cookies marked as HttpOnly and Secure protect the session ID from XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) and other attacks.
Ease of Use:
Developers don't need to manually manage or store session IDs on the frontend.
What Happens in the Provided Code?
In your code:

php
Copy code
return response()->json(['message' => 'Login successful.']);
The actual session cookie (laravel_session) is sent in the HTTP headers, not in the JSON response body.
The frontend doesn't need to do anything special to handle this, as the browser manages the cookie automatically.
If You Need to Debug the Session Cookie
To see the session cookie being sent, you can:

Use browser developer tools (Network tab) to inspect the Set-Cookie header in the login response.
Log cookies on the frontend to verify they are stored correctly.
Summary
Laravel sends the session ID as a cookie in the Set-Cookie header of the HTTP response.
The browser stores and sends this cookie with subsequent requests.
You don’t need to manually send or handle the session ID in the JSON response. It’s managed transparently by the browser and Laravel's session management system.

what about tokens for apis? does laravel automatically handle this also (to send data to the frontend) or we (developers) need to handle this through json response?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
For token-based authentication in APIs (such as when using Laravel Sanctum's personal access tokens), Laravel does not automatically send the token to the frontend. Instead, the developer must explicitly include the token in the JSON response when creating or issuing the token. Here's how it works in detail:

How Tokens for APIs Work
Generate the Token:

When a user is authenticated, a personal access token is created using the createToken() method.
Send the Token to the Frontend:

You, as the developer, include the generated token in the JSON response so the frontend can store it for subsequent use.
Frontend Stores the Token:

The frontend is responsible for securely storing the token (e.g., in localStorage, sessionStorage, or a secure cookie).
Send the Token with Requests:

The frontend includes the token in the Authorization header for every API request.
Laravel Validates the Token:

The auth:sanctum middleware validates the token for protected routes.
Example Code: Token-Based API Authentication
Issuing a Token
Here’s an example of how to issue a token and send it to the frontend:

php
Copy code
use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;

Route::post('/login', function (Request $request) {
    // Validate credentials
    $credentials = $request->validate([
        'email' => 'required|email',
        'password' => 'required',
    ]);

    if (Auth::attempt($credentials)) {
        // Generate a personal access token
        $user = Auth::user();
        $token = $user->createToken('API Token')->plainTextToken;

        // Return the token in the JSON response
        return response()->json([
            'message' => 'Login successful.',
            'token' => $token,
            'user' => $user, // Optional: Include user details
        ]);
    }

    return response()->json(['message' => 'Invalid credentials'], 401);
});
Frontend Responsibilities
On the frontend, you must handle the token manually:

1. Store the Token
Store the token securely for use in API requests. For example, in localStorage:
javascript
Copy code
localStorage.setItem('authToken', token);
2. Send the Token with API Requests
Include the token in the Authorization header for subsequent requests:
javascript
Copy code
const token = localStorage.getItem('authToken');

axios.get('/api/protected-route', {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
  },
})
.then(response => console.log(response.data))
.catch(error => console.error(error));
Protected Routes in Laravel
On the Laravel backend, you protect routes using the auth:sanctum middleware:

php
Copy code
Route::middleware('auth:sanctum')->get('/protected-route', function () {
    return response()->json(['message' => 'Access granted.']);
});
If the token is valid, the route will execute normally. If not, Laravel will return a 401 Unauthorized response.

Comparison: Session vs Token Management
Feature	Session-Based Authentication	Token-Based Authentication
Automatic Handling by Laravel	Yes (via cookies)	No (developer sends token manually via JSON)
Frontend Storage	Browser-managed cookies	Developer-managed (e.g., localStorage, cookies)
Request Authentication	Handled via session cookie	Requires Authorization header with token
Use Case	SPAs on same domain	APIs, mobile apps, third-party integrations
Why Laravel Doesn't Handle Tokens Automatically?
Flexibility:

Developers may want to customize how tokens are sent or stored.
Different applications (e.g., mobile apps vs. SPAs) require different handling.
Security Concerns:

Tokens must be stored securely, and Laravel leaves this responsibility to the frontend.
Summary
For token-based authentication in APIs, Laravel does not automatically handle sending the token to the frontend. You must:

Generate the token using createToken().
Include the token in your JSON response.
Rely on the frontend to store and include the token in the Authorization header for subsequent requests.

explain usecases of sessions and tokens? where are they better suited?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Use Cases of Sessions vs Tokens
Both sessions and tokens are used for managing authentication and maintaining state in web applications, but they have distinct advantages and are better suited for different scenarios. Below is a detailed comparison and explanation of their use cases.

1. Session-Based Authentication
How It Works
Sessions store user authentication data on the server side.
A unique session ID is sent to the client via a cookie.
The client includes the session ID cookie with each request, allowing the server to validate the session and authenticate the user.
Key Features
Server-side state management.
Automatic handling of cookies by browsers.
Requires the client and server to share the same origin (domain) or handle cross-origin cookies securely.
When to Use Sessions
Web Applications with Server-Side Rendering (SSRs):

Applications where the backend generates the HTML and delivers it directly to the client.
Example: Traditional websites, content management systems (CMS), or blogs.
Single-Origin Applications:

When the frontend and backend are hosted on the same domain or subdomains.
Example: frontend.example.com and api.example.com.
Short-Lived Authentication:

Use cases where user sessions are short-lived and don’t require persistent authentication across devices.
Example: Internal tools or admin dashboards.
Security-Critical Applications:

Applications requiring tight security where server-side control over authentication data is critical.
Example: Banking or financial applications.
Advantages
More Secure: Session data is stored on the server, reducing the risk of token theft or misuse.
Automatic Cookie Management: Browsers handle cookies automatically, making it easy to implement.
Server-Side Control: Sessions can be invalidated directly by the server (e.g., on logout).
Limitations
Scalability Issues: Managing sessions in a distributed environment (e.g., with multiple servers) requires additional infrastructure, like shared storage (Redis, database).
Cross-Origin Limitations: Cookies can be challenging to configure securely for cross-origin applications.
2. Token-Based Authentication
How It Works
Tokens (like JWTs or Laravel Sanctum's personal access tokens) are stateless and typically stored on the client side.
The client sends the token in the Authorization header with each request.
The server validates the token without maintaining state.
Key Features
Stateless, meaning the server does not store session data.
Suitable for APIs and distributed systems.
Tokens can include additional metadata, such as expiration time and user roles.
When to Use Tokens
APIs and Microservices:

Ideal for RESTful APIs or GraphQL APIs where clients (frontend, mobile apps, third-party services) need access.
Example: Public APIs or internal microservices.
Mobile Applications:

When building mobile apps that need to authenticate users and make API requests.
Example: A shopping app that allows users to log in and manage their account.
Cross-Origin Applications:

When the frontend and backend are hosted on different domains, and managing cookies across origins is impractical.
Example: A React SPA hosted on frontend.example.com and an API on api.example.com.
Long-Lived Authentication:

Use cases where users need to stay logged in across devices or sessions persist over a long time.
Example: Social media apps or subscription-based platforms.
Third-Party Integrations:

Tokens enable external applications to access APIs securely without exposing user credentials.
Example: OAuth flows, where a third-party app accesses a user’s resources on their behalf.
Advantages
Stateless: No server-side storage for authentication data, making it highly scalable.
Cross-Origin Friendly: No reliance on cookies, making it easier to handle cross-origin requests.
Flexible: Suitable for multiple client types (web, mobile, IoT, etc.).
Customizable: Tokens can carry user-specific claims or metadata.
Limitations
Security Concerns: Tokens stored on the client side (e.g., in localStorage) are vulnerable to theft (e.g., XSS attacks).
Manual Management: Developers must handle token storage, sending headers, and expiration/refresh logic.
Revocation Complexity: Stateless tokens are harder to revoke compared to sessions.
Comparison Table: Sessions vs Tokens
Feature	Sessions	Tokens
State Management	Server-side	Stateless (client-side)
Storage	Managed by the server (session store)	Managed by the client (localStorage, etc.)
Use Case	SSR apps, single-origin, security-critical	APIs, cross-origin apps, mobile apps
Authentication	Cookie-based	Header-based (Authorization: Bearer)
Scalability	Challenging for distributed systems	Easily scalable
Cross-Origin Compatibility	Requires cookie management	Easy with headers
Security	More secure (data is not client-exposed)	Requires careful client-side handling
Ease of Use	Easy (browser handles cookies)	Requires manual token handling
When to Use Which?
Use Sessions:

When building traditional web apps with server-side rendering.
When the frontend and backend are hosted on the same domain.
When security is a top priority and you want to manage user sessions server-side.
Use Tokens:

When building APIs that need to support multiple client types (web, mobile, third-party).
When the frontend and backend are on different domains.
When scalability and statelessness are important (e.g., microservices architecture).
Hybrid Approach
In some cases, you might combine both approaches:

Use sessions for first-party applications (e.g., SPAs on the same domain).
Use tokens for third-party access or mobile apps.
Conclusion
The choice between sessions and tokens depends on your application’s architecture, use case, and security requirements. Sessions are ideal for traditional web apps and single-origin setups, while tokens are better suited for APIs, mobile apps, and distributed systems.



*******************************************************************************************************************



tokens make use of personal_access_tokens in the db. what tables and columns are used by session based authentication?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
In session-based authentication in Laravel, the authentication system primarily relies on sessions, which are stored by default in one of several possible session storage mechanisms (like files, databases, Redis, etc.). Unlike token-based authentication, which typically uses a separate table for storing tokens (e.g., personal_access_tokens), session-based authentication does not require a dedicated database table for storing session data. Instead, Laravel uses a session table (if configured) and session cookies to manage user sessions.

Session-Based Authentication in Laravel
1. Session Storage Mechanism
Laravel stores session data in the session storage, which can be configured to use different backends like:

File (default)
Database
Redis
Memcached
The most important aspect here is that session data is stored on the server, and each session is associated with a session ID. This session ID is stored in a cookie on the client side.

2. Session Table (Optional)
If you choose to store sessions in a database (instead of files or other storage mechanisms), you will use a sessions table. Laravel provides an artisan command to create this table.

Creating the Session Table
To create a session table in the database (if you're using database-backed sessions), you run the following artisan command:

bash
Copy code
php artisan session:table
php artisan migrate
This will generate a table with the following columns:

sessions Table Structure
Here is the typical structure of the sessions table:

Column Name	Type	Description
id	string (255)	A unique identifier for the session (session ID). This is used to link the session data with the client.
user_id	unsigned integer	(Optional) The ID of the authenticated user associated with the session. If the user is logged in, this is populated.
ip_address	string (45)	The IP address of the client making the request.
user_agent	string (255)	The user agent (browser/device) string of the client making the request.
payload	text	A serialized blob of session data (actual session values stored here).
last_activity	timestamp	The timestamp when the session was last active (used for session expiration).
Columns Breakdown:
id: This column stores the session ID, which is sent as a cookie to the client (laravel_session), allowing the server to identify the user in future requests.

user_id: This is an optional column. If your application is using user authentication (e.g., via auth middleware), this column will store the ID of the user who is logged in. It makes it easy to associate a session with a specific user.

ip_address: Stores the client's IP address to track where the session originated.

user_agent: Stores the user agent (browser or device type) to track the client’s environment.

payload: This column stores serialized session data. Laravel stores the actual session content here (e.g., the user's login state, preferences, or any other data tied to the session).

last_activity: This timestamp tracks when the session was last active. Laravel uses this to determine if the session has expired or should be garbage-collected.

Session Storage Configuration
You can configure the session storage mechanism in the config/session.php file. For example, to use the database as the session driver, you would set:

php
Copy code
// config/session.php

'driver' => 'database',
Then, you'd configure the connection (if necessary):

php
Copy code
'connection' => null, // Uses default database connection
Session Cookies
When using session-based authentication, Laravel automatically handles session cookies for you. These cookies are used to store the session ID on the client side, which is sent back to the server with every request to authenticate the user.

By default, Laravel uses the following cookie for session management:

laravel_session: This cookie contains the session ID, which corresponds to a session record in the sessions table (if using the database driver).
How It Works in Practice
Login:

The user submits their credentials (e.g., email and password).
Laravel validates the credentials and if they are correct, it starts a session for the user.
The session ID is generated and stored in the session table (if using the database driver).
The session ID is then sent to the client as a cookie (laravel_session).
Subsequent Requests:

For each subsequent request, the browser sends the session ID cookie (laravel_session) to the server.
The server retrieves the session data from the session store (e.g., database) using the session ID.
If the session is valid (i.e., it has not expired), the user is considered authenticated, and the request continues.
Logout:

When the user logs out, the session is invalidated, and the session ID is removed from the server (and the cookie is deleted from the client).
Summary of Tables and Columns Used in Session-Based Authentication
Table Name	sessions (only if using database driver)
Columns	id, user_id, ip_address, user_agent, payload, last_activity
Session ID	Stored in the id column of the sessions table
User Data	Optionally stored in the user_id column if the user is authenticated
Conclusion
Session-based authentication in Laravel does not require a dedicated table for user management. Instead, it uses the sessions table (if configured) to store session data, session IDs, and potentially user data.
For stateless authentication (e.g., with APIs or across multiple devices), token-based authentication (like Laravel Sanctum) is more appropriate.
Sessions are ideal for traditional web applications where you want to maintain state on the server and rely on the browser to handle cookies.
